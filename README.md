# What ?
A software that allows an end user to control a smart car remotely in a less traditional way by using the GUI we created (either a mobile app or a web based controller). Besides, the smart car can detect obstacles around it and avoid it using embedded sensors for it to travel freely.
# Why ?
The main objective of this software is to utilize and demonstrate the use of a real-time based embedded system in this case a functional user interface with the smart car emulator. One of our main goals is to implement a responsible GUI which can easily control all the functionality in the smart car emulator.This project is to encourage sustainable development and that to showcase that reasearch and development can be done in a pandemic without physical components of the car. Test cases can be run on the car using the emulator which would be identical to real-time testing on a physical car.   
  

# What does it solove ?
Aid the driver with more information about surroundings located around the car.It also reduces human error and time during the  operation.For example, It helps people park the car and give suggestions when people are controlling the car.It contains autonomous driving which allows the car to park by itself.

# How ? 
We are going to solve the above mentioned problems through an agile method of working. To do so we are going to have regular group meetings in which we discuss and decide our tasks that we are going to complete till the next meeting. In addition we will also have Q&A sessions with the TAâ€™s or teachers throughout the time we are working on the project to have regular feedback or suggestions on the product we are creating.
