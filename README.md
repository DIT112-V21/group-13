# What ?
A software that allows an end user to control a smart car remotely in a less traditional way by using the GUI we created (either a mobile app or a web based controller). Besides, the smart car can detect obstacles around it and avoid it using embedded sensors for it to travel freely.
# Why ?
User story: As a car i should be able to look at the speed of my moving vehicle to keep it under speed limits.
Acceptance criteria: Live speedometer display projected directly from the car.

Scenario 1: The car owner is at a shopping mall or supermarket and has a bunch of groceries and bags in hand, the car is parked far away from the entrance and it is quite difficult to get to the car.

Scenario 2: It is pouring down with rain and the family is stranded at the entrance of their establishment they were not prepared for the sudden rain, the car is parked outside at a carpark  and they family cannot reach to the car due to the heavy rainfall.

Scenario 3: The car owner wants to check up on the car to check if everything is ok and is out of danger, a check around the surroundings would give the owner assurance their car is fine.


The main objective of this software is to utilize and demonstrate the use of a real-time based embedded system in this case a functional user interface with the smart car emulator. One of our main goals is to implement a responsible GUI which can easily control all the functionality in the smart car emulator.  

# What does it solove ?
Aid the driver with more information about surroundings located around the car.It also reduces human error and time during the  operation.For example, It helps people park the car and give suggestions when people are controlling the car.It contains autonomous driving which allows the car to park by itself.

# How ? 
We are going to solve the above mentioned problems through an agile method of working. To do so we are going to have regular group meetings in which we discuss and decide our tasks that we are going to complete till the next meeting. In addition we will also have Q&A sessions with the TAâ€™s or teachers throughout the time we are working on the project to have regular feedback or suggestions on the product we are creating.
